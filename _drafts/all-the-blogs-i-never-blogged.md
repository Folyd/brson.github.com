title: "All the blogs I never blogged"
tags: [rust]
---

It feels like I can't blog anymore. It was always hard. It's getting harder.

I think the more time passes the worse my performance anxiety becomes: I expect
a lot from myself, and as I result I accomplish little. It takes extraordinary
effort to complete any project.

At this moment I am feeling an acute sense of self-destructive self-despair, and
so I am publishing all my blog drafts in unfinished and mostly-unedited form. My
thinking is that I will at least have accomplished something, and that maybe
this will stir my motivation out of the local minimum I've been wallowing in
lately.

Maybe this will help others feel less bad about all the blogs they never
blogged.

These are all incomplete and unedited. Some are very old. Some are too personal
to publish but here they are.

Although on their own each piece is incomplete and unsatisfactory, perhaps
together, they add up to a cohesive artwork. A snapshot of failure.
