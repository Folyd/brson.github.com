<p>
  I helped make
  <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org">this one great thing</a>.
  I do other things too.
</p>

<p>
  My
  <a href="/rust-stuff.html">stuff</a>
  is on
  <a href="http://github.com/brson">GitHub</a>.
  I keep a
  <a href="/worklog.html">worklog</a>.
  I rarely
  <a href="/blog/index.html">blog</a>,
  though I do like
  <a href="/writing.html">writing</a>.
</p>

<p>
  Currently I am employed by <a href="https://pingcap.com">PingCAP</a> to hack
  on the <a href="https://tikv.org">TiKV</a> database, and represent their
  interests in the Rust community with my
  &#127752;&nbsp;&#10084;&#65039; <!-- rainbow heart -->
  personality (such as it is …).
</p>

<p>
  My <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/andersrb/">LinkedIn</a> page is pretty
  up to date, and I accept connection requests, though perhaps belatedly. My
  status there will indicate whether I'm looking for gigs or not. I also have a
  traditional <a href="/resume.html">resume</a>, if you are into those.
</p>

<p id="contact">
  I like making friends! Currently the best way to contact me is on Telegram
  (<a href="https://t.me/MrBrianAnderson">MrBrianAnderson</a>), though email
  (<emph>andersrb@gmail.com</emph>) also works. I won't notice GitHub pings. It
  can be difficult to get a response from me, mostly due to my extreme inbox
  anxiety. If you keep trying, I won't be offended, and your chances of success
  will improve.
