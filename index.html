	20 years ago people would be pronouncing "brson" out loud and that would

  I helped make
  <a href="http://www.rust-lang.org">this one awesome thing</a>.
  There's more to me than that though.
</p>

<p>
  My
  <a href="/rust-stuff.html">stuff</a>
  is on
  <a href="http://github.com/brson">GitHub</a>.
  I keep a
  <a href="/worklog.html">worklog</a>.
  I rarely
  <a href="/blog/index.html">blog</a>,
  though I do like
  <a href="/writing.html">writing</a>.
</p>

<p>
  My <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/andersrb/">LinkedIn</a> page is pretty
  up to date, and I accept connection requests, though often belatedly. My
  status there will indicate whether I'm looking for gigs or not. I also have
  one of those traditional <a href="/resume.html">resumes</a>, if you are into
  those.

  Currently employed by <a href="https://pingcap.com">PingCAP</a> to hack on
  the <a href="https://tikv.org">TiKV</a> database, and represent their interests
  in the Rust community with my

<p id="contact">
  I like making friends! If you want to contact me please send email to
  <emph>andersrb@gmail.com</emph>, or ping me directly on various chat
  platforms, like Telegram, WeChat, or Rust discord. Other methods of contact,
  including GitHub pings, are unlikely to be noticed, though I will generally
  sweep through LinkedIn messages every few months. If I don't respond quickly,
  it's not because I don't care &mdash; it's mostly because of extreme inbox
  anxiety. If you keep trying, I won't be offended, and your chances of success
  will improve.
