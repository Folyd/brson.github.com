	people would be pronouncing "brson" out loud and that would be my permanent

	minutes and come up with something pronouncable).

  I helped make

  My <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/andersrb/">LinkedIn</a> page is pretty
  up to date, and I accept connection requests, though often quite belatedly. My
  status there will indicate whether I'm looking for gigs or not. I also have
  one of those traditional <a href="/resume.html">resume</a> things, if that's
  your bag.

  If you want to contact me please send email to andersrb@gmail.com, or ping me
  directly on various chat platforms, like WeChat, Telegram, Rust discord,.  Other methods of contact, including GitHub
  pings and LinkedIn messages, are unlikely to be noticed. If I don't respond
  quickly, it's not because I don't care &mdash; it's mostly because of extreme inbox
  anxiety. If you keep trying, I won't be offended.
