## Appearance

Again I failed to take note of the head before it dissipated.

Amber and translucent.

## Smell

I ask Aimee if it smells like "peepee" and she says no.

So perhaps not peepee.

Yes, asparagus peepee.
I stand by it.

Aimee is reminded of leather.

## Taste

Oh, yes.
It tastes vegetal.

Fascinating.
I definitely haven't experienced this flavor in a beer recently.

Aimee and I have very different experiences of this beer.

My perception of vegetables recedes the more I drink.

Malty and a bit astringent,
some moderate bitterness.

## Mouthfeel

Whatever.

## Overall

Surprising.
Not as simple as I expected.
My expectations about lagers continue to be challenged.
The malt expression does remind me of the Paulaner Munich lager I have had recently,
but this is much more bitter.
Definitely prefer it the dull Paulaner.
