# Taste

A lot hoppier than I expected.
Bitter.
A little sour.
Not a lot of fruit.
Doesn't taste like a typical Belgian.
Bitterness lingers, coating the back of the mouth.

## Mouthfeel

Smooth.

## Overall

It reminds me more of an American IPA than a Belgian blonde,
Although I don't think this tastes like a blonde,
I like the lack of sweetness,
have been tired of sweet Belgian styles lately.
I drank it fast and still want more.
