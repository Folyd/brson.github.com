Sweet and Sour Grapefruit IPA.
Untitled Art.
Waunakee, WI.

I tasted this before reading carefully their own description,
but they describe it as
"India pale ale with grapefruit juice, apple juice and pineapple juice".

7% ABV.

## Appearance

Oh wow.
Our eyes went wide as we poured this.

It pours like thick pineapple juice.

Gorgeous.

Head dissipates quickly.

## Smell

It smells like canned peaches.

Not grapefruit,
as the beer's name suggests.

Some pineapple.

Such a strong,
fruity smell.

It smells amazing.

I'm expecting this to taste like juice.

Can I rate it higher than 5?

## Taste

Woah.

It tastes like juice.

Truly,
like sparkling grapefruit juice.

Is this really beer?

Maybe it's just grapefruit juice and vodka.

Ok, reading the label,
this is an IPA
that is,
I think,
_mixed_ with grapefruit,
pineapple,
and apple juice.

So it's basically a juice cocktail.

It's 7% ABV though so it must have a lot of IPA in it.

It tastes good though.

## Mouthfeel

Like sparkling grapefruit juice.

Pretty thick and leaves a long lasting coating on the back of the throat.

## Overall

This is new to me and I want to try more in this style.

A strong hazy IPA plus citrus juice,
it works amazingly well.

Their website says this is "brewed with juice",
but I think it must be "mixed with juice".

I'm very curious how much of this is beer.
I guess it must be made with juice concentrates
in order to preserve such a high ABV.

It's not really fair to compare this to beers.
This is alcoholic juice.

It tastes so yummy I can hardly rate it bad though.
