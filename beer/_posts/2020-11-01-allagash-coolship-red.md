Coolship Red.
Allagash brewery.
Portland, Maine.

"Spontaneously fermented ale aged with raspberries".

This is a special beer,
naturally fermented,
aged for over two years,
with added raspberry.

I am expecting it to bee very sweet and sour.

## Appearance

Great, unique color.
Tint of red.
Dark red grapefruit.

Very little head that dissipates fast,
but lots of visible carbonation.

## Smell

Fruity and sour.
Berries.
Cherries.

Aimee says "passionfruit".

Very pleasant.

## Taste

"Whoah!"

Very sour. A little sweet.

Berries don't really come through in the taste like they do with the smell.

Taste doesn't evince the oak aging.

This is a challenging drink.

## Mouthfeel

Whatever.

## Overall

This is a challenging sipping drink.

I wouldn't drink this often, and only one at a time, slowly.
