Black Butte Porter.
Deschutes Brewery.
Bend, Oregon.

5.5% ABV.

I love porter!

I've previously enjoyed this brewery's Obsidian Stout.

## Appearance

Black.

Slightly tan head fades fast.

Sometimes hard to rate these black beers as having a good appearance,
especially when the have no head,
but this one has a head.

It looks like a beer.

And that's usually what I want out of beer.

## Smell

No smell.

I must have coronavirus.
For real this time?
Another false alarm?
What is wrong with my nose?
I don't have the nose for beer tasting.
Am I a beer-tasting failure?

No smell.

Aimee objects:
"No! It smells like caramel and banana".

Clearly, she does not have the coronavirus.

Aimee unpeels a banana and makes me smell it.
That does indeed smell like a banana.

I smell the beer.

No banana.

Aimee is now eating the banana.
I am disappointed in her beer-tasting discipline.
She has banana-palate now.

I smell the beer again.

Nothing.

I am obligated to rate this lowly,
though it does not smell offensive.

## Taste

It's simple.

Malty.

More bitter than some porters,
which I appreciate.
I don't love beers that are just malt,
though I do love malty beers.

I wish this were hoppier still though.

It tastes like malt.
I have no other description.
Just simple and malty.

The Ayinger Celebrator dopplebock was
another beer I recently had that I could only describe as malty,
just super prominent malt and nothing else.

This is darker and roastier and not as sweet.

That one I didn't like much at all.

This is a decent drinking beer.

## Mouthfeel

This is not a heavily carbonated beer,
and porters without a lot of carbonation
really hit you with the syrupy mouthfeel.

## Overall

This is surprising and disappointing.

I thought their Obsidian Stout was excellent,
a beer I could drink all the time,
and I expected this to be comparable.

Now I want to go back and review a case of those again.
Have my tastes changed?
They constantly do.

And thankfully so;
life is so interesting when things are changing.

Anyway, this is fine,
but boring.

I wish it had more character,
more hops,
more carbonation.
Just something to help it stand out.
