Christmas Ale.
Breckenridge Brewery.
Breckenridge, CO (presumably).

"Malty full-bodied winter warmer".

"Winter warmer"?

I am sure I've never had a beer that made me warm.

7.1% ABV.

WTF is a Christmas ale, really?
I'm not gonna Google it.
I don't care.

## Appearance

Poors a nice frothy white head.
Translucent amber.

## Smell

Only a slight smell.

Malty and a bit fruity.

Oh no, I inhaled beer again.
I keep doing this.
It feels weird going down the back of my nose.

Why is smelling beer so hard?

I'm bad at this.

## Taste

It does taste a little like Christmas.

How is that possible?
What does Christmas taste like?
I could imagine drinking this while building
a gingerbread house,
then trying to eat that gingerbread house
and realizing that it looks a lot better than it tastes.

This is beer for building gingerbread houses.
Yes.

It's malty and a bit sweet,
a bit generically holiday-spiced.

Better than I expected.

## Mouthfeel

Smooth.

## Overall

It's fine.
I'm glad I only have a single bottle.
