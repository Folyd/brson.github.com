## Smell

Light and crips.
Apple juice.

Aimee questions "apple juice??".

I _was_ thinking about apple juice by its appearance,
so maybe I just rolled that thought over to the smell.

## Taste

Oh that's refreshing.
Crisp and drinkable.
Slight bitterness.
Not sweet.

Aside from the slight bitterness,
this beer's flavors are mild
and indistinct.

Aftertaste fades fast.

## Mouthfeel

Smooth.

## Overall

Extremely drinkable.
We drank it fast.

Excellent beer.

I'd drink this any time,
but wouldn't go out of my way for it.
