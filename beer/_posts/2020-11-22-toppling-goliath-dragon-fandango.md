Dragon Fandango.
Toppling Goliath Brewery.
Decorah, IA.

"Beer with mango, passion fruit, and dragon fruit".

No indication of the ABV,
also no indication of what _kind_ of beer this is,
just beer with fruit.

I like this brewery a lot,
but I'm a bit aprehensive about this.

## Appearance

Looks like fruit punch.

No head,
but some evident carbonation.

I'm expecting it to be sour and sweet.

## Smell

Strong sour and sweet flavor.
Very fruity, but I'm not sure what kind:
it doesn't smell much like mango or dragonfruit,
so I'm assuming the passionfruit is coming through.
Some mango.

It doesn't smell like what I want out of a _beer_,
but for something sour-fruity,
it does smell good.

## Taste

It's sour.

I wish I knew what passionfruit tastes like.
I think I can taste the mango,
and dragonfruit itself has such a mild flavor that it's hard to image how it fits in here.

But containing dragon fruit means the beer can have "dragon" in the name.

Aimee shows me a picture of passionfruit,
and yeah,
this tastes like passionfruit.

Anyway, this is too sour for anything but a curious tasting.

Hard to drink.

This doesn't taste _bad_.
It probably tastes _good_,
but maybe for a child craving some delicious candy,
not for an old man craving a refreshing beer.

## Mouthfeel

A bit too viscous for me,
like drinking juice.

Fizzy like a seltzer.

## Overall

Sour beers are a frontier I've yet to explore,
but this is so hard to drink,
just aggressively sweet and sour.

Like everything I'm sure its an acquired taste.

It's going to be a chore finishing the case of these.

It's on my agenda to taste more sour beers.
