## Appearance

Hazy straw.
Hazy natural apple juice.
Almost no head.

## Smell

Bright and sweet.
Smells like a Hoegaarden,
but the bottle doesn't indicate this is a wheat bear.

I want to drink.

## Taste

Tastes like I expect from the smell,
like a Hoegaarden.

I probably like it better than a Hoegaarden,
which I come back to periodically but am always a bit disappointed by.

Very sweet,
appropriate mild bitterness.

Alcohol.

## Mouthfeel

A bit viscous.
The bitterness coats the mouth.

I'm noticing that most of the beers I drink
linger for a while in a way that isn't all that pleasant.

## Overall

Nothing like a Belgian Tripel,
but more like a Witbier.
But it's good.

Another surprising beer from Allagash.
The second that didn't accurately mimick the claimed Belgian style.

It tastes to me like a wheat bear,
but it contains no wheat.
