## Appearance

Dark urine.
No clouds.
Pours a slight head that quickly dissipates into a fizzy pool of variable bubble size,
with the appearance of a perfectly polluted stream.

Tiny bubbles percolating up the glass.

## Smell

Very slight smell.
Don't have the vocabulary to describe it.
Only notable for its absense.

## Taste

Plain.
Traditional.
Almost like an American macro,
but not as metallic and boring.
A slight bitterness,
but this is not a beer with a strong hops character.

Aimee describes it as "balanced",
but also "flat".

## Mouthfeel

Simple,
a bit of fizzy.
Fine.

## Overall

This is a prototypical beer.

I could drink a half dozen of these,
and would much prefer it to Budweiser,
but don't prefer it to the German pilsners I've had recently,
particularly the Ayinger.
