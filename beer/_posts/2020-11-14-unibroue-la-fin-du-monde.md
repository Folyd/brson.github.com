La Fin Du Monde.
Unibroue.
Chambly, Canada.

"Belgian Style Tripel Ale".

9% ABV.

Had this one sitting in the refrigerator for a while,
since we were super into strong Belgian ales.

I've been trying to prove to Aimee that American's
(or in this case, Canadians)
can brew a strong Belgian ale the equal of a Belgian Abbey,
and so far have failed badly.

Will that change today?

## Appearance

Easy pour to a consistent head of tiny bubbles.

Cloudy urine,
browning gold.
Wet straw.

The color isn't too inviting.

## Smell

Sweet and fruity alcoholic,
typical of the style.


## Taste

Hey it's a pretty accurate example of the style!

It has a spiciness that reminds of cloves.
Maybe some apple.

I notice that several American Belgian-style ales
I've had are brewed with additional spices,
but I don't _think_ the authentic beers have spices.

Need to learn more.

I'm really getting tired of this style.
