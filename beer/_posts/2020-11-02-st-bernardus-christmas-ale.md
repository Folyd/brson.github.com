## Appearance

Pours real frothy,
with big bubbles.
Easy to pour too aggressively and create a huge heady mess.

Dark mahogany,
brown with a tint of red.

Opaque.

## Smell

Acidic and fruity.
Smells like an abbey ale.

Cherries perhaps.

Smell is not that strong,
even after swirling.

## Taste

Sour fruity alcohol.
Non-specific fruit.

Aftertaste has a lingering bitterness
that is kind of unpleasant.

It has a stronger sour-bitterness
than their Abt 12 quad,
which I have had a lot of recently.
Complex.

It tastes slightly spicy,
and I wonder if it has perhaps a cinnamon in it.

## Mouthfeel

Medium.

## Overall

Like their Abt 12 quad,
but I don't like it as much.

The flavor is just not as palettable.
