River Trip.
Allagash brewery,
Portland, Maine.

"Belgian-style session ale".

Brewed with coriander.

## Appearance

Hazy, gold, orange tint.
1cm head that holds up pretty well.

## Smell

Citrusy. Lemon. Pomelo. Smells like it will be crisp and refreshing.

## Taste

Spoiled. Funky. Dull.
Not sweet like it smells.
Horse manure.
I can't quite identify it,
but something "wrong" hit me right away.
It's not completely repulsive,
but it's not a flavor I'm familiar with.
Maybe it's the coriander.

Every time I taste it I think it's wierd,
give the memory a few seconds to fade,
try again,
thinking I will acclimate to it,
and am struck by the wierdness anew.

I've gone back and tasted it so many times,
and my impression just gets worse.

## Mouthfeel

Bitterness lingers on the tongue.
My mouth feels a bit numb.
I'm smacking my tongue around to try to clean my mouth out.

## Overall

Does not remind me at all of Belgian beers,
even less so than the Devotion Blonde.
Not something I would seek out,
but I would try it again
to see if my opinion of it improved.

I said outlout that I don't like it,
a rarity.

"This is a disgusting beer".
