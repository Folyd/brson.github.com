Bavarian Pils.
Ayinger.
Aying, Germany.



## Appearance

Clear and light gold, or perhaps light urine.
Bubbly.
Decently thick head that clings to glass as it recedes.

## Smell

Smell is very attractive.
I want to smell deeply.

I accidentally tipped the glass too close to my nose and inhaled.
It was not an unpleasant inhale.

Citrusy, acidic.

"I love this smell".

## Taste

It's so good.

Refreshing.

The satisfaction on the first sip is like taking the first sip of a cold Coke,
but without the regret of drinking viscous sugary syrup.

Very drinkable.

A little bitter.
The bitterness lingers.
No malt.

Could drink this all day.

## Mouthfeel

Goes down easy.
Not thick and viscous.
Effervescent.

I don't have the strong sensation of my mouth being coated the way I did with yesterday's ales,
at least not as strongly.

## Overall

I've avoided pilsners for the most part because they are not "interesting",
but I'm super impressed with this beer.

Definitely something I could drink a lot of.
