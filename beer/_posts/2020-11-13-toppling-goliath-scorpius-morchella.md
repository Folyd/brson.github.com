Scorpius Morchella Double India Pale Ale.
Toppling Goliath Brewery.
Decorah, IA.

Loving this brewery lately.
This is another of their many IPAs.

## Appearance

Gorgeous pour with a perfectly controlled, fluffy head.
Cloudy light orange.

## Smell

Sweet-sour-fruity-tangerine.

I think this will be refreshing and juicy.

Aimee says "passionfruit".

I was so excited I immediately knocked over the glass and spilled
Scorpius Morchella all over our coffee table and area rug.
It was a disaster: at least half our of beer lost.
And this isn't some Allagash disaster where losing half the bottle would be a blessing;
this is a Toppling Goliath IPA.

I think the disturbance of knocking over the whole glass
brought out some new scents.

There's a slight footy funk left over.
Only a slight one.

## Taste

Not as sweet and fruity as I had anticipated,
but there is sweetness there.
Bitter sour.

Aimee says "watermelon fresh".

I don't get watermelon.

It suggests fruit juice but it's hard to identify as a specific fruit.
Perhaps slightly like mango.

I keep thinking of a sour fruit candy,
but dulled of the overpowing ascorbic acidity.

It's good,
though perhaps not as good as some of the brewery's others.

## Mouthfeel

Typical of the style.

## Overall

Yummy.

I am sad I fed half of it to our carpet.
