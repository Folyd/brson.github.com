title: Dogfish Head 60 Minute IPA
---

60 Minute IPA.
Dogfish Head Brewery.
Milton, DE.

6% ABV.

Continuing our Nty Minute IPA journey,
we started with the 120 Minute,
then the 90 Minute,
now finally the baby 60 Minute.

Although I wasn't initially too excited by the 90 Minute,
but like the 120 Minute I found myself craving it
any time I wasn't in its presence,
and kept coming back to it eagerly.

So I'm expecting this to be yummy.

I indirectly compared the 90 Minute to Bell's Two Hearted,
feeling they had similar character,
but 90 Minute was a 9% ABV imperial IPA,
and this one is 6% ABV,
more comparable to Two Hearted's 7%.

## Appearance

Pours easily to a perfect pillowy head.

Bright orange and cloudy.

I recall the 90 Minute being less cloudy than I expected.
This seems more cloudy than that.

Looks delicious.

## Smell

Definitely fruity.

I feel like peaches.

A little citrus.

Smell is a bit faint,
but definitely there.

## Taste

Huh.

It's not as fruity as I was expecting.
The taste is generally milder than I was expecting.

Goes down real easy.

The hops expression is strong.
It's bitter.

I detect something a bit off in it, musty.
The word "horse" keeps coming to mind,
but it's definitely not a barnyard.

## Mouthfeel

Smooth.

## Overall

Super drinkable.
I like it.
More than the 90 Minute?
I don't know yet.
More than Bell's Two Hearted?
I don't know yet.

But I intend to find out.
