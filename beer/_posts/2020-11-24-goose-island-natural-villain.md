## Appearance

Poors a perfect, slightly yellow-tinted head
that fades disappointingly fast.

Classic dark peepee color.
Golden and translucent.

## Smell

Apple juice.

Aimee objects to "apple juice".

Apple juice I say.

The smell is faint,
but promises great refreshment.

## Taste

It's a super-nothing taste.
Light and refreshing.
Could drink this all day long.

There's nothing bad in it though like you would expect from a cheap macro brew.

## Mouthfeel

Smooth and light.

## Overall

This is something you can sit around with friends all day and smash,
without thinking at all about what you are drinking.

If I were responsible for organizing a house party,
and told to bring 4 dozen Budweisers,
I would quietly bring this instead.
I don't think anybody would object.

I kinda want to give it a 5 for being so drinkable but it's just so uninteresting.

The more of this I drink the more in awe I am of it's amazing boringness.
