Tripel.
St. Bernardus.
Watau, Belgium.

I've hard their Abt 12 quadruppel a lot recently,
which is one of my favorite Belgian abbey ales,
and recently tried their Christmas ale.

I don't think I've had this one before.

## Appearance

Big frothy head.
This beer has to be poured carefully to avoid a glass full of bubbles.
Thick and foamy.

Cloudy natural apple cider.
Too cloudy and dark for urine.

This is an apple juice beer,
not a urine beer.

## Smell

Surprisingly light smell :-l


## Taste

Classic Belgian tripel taste.
Sour and sweet and a little bitter,
but not overly sour like a lambic.

Crisp and drinkable,
but complex and challenging.

This is hard for me to describe in terms of non-beer flavors.
It tastes like a Belgian tripel.

I believe the flavor is most strongly expressed
by the yeast, not the malt or hops.

Aftertaste fades pretty fast.

## Mouthfeel

Medium.

## Overall

Classic Belgian tripel.
More enjoyable than their Christmas ale I tried recently.

Perhaps my favorite Belgian brewery.

I am kind of tired of Belgian abbey ales though,
have had too many of them recently.
