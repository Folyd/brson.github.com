## Smell

Hard to pick up on.
Mild.

Effectively no smell,
but at least it doesn't smell bad.

## Taste

Malty.
Malty and burned.

It's a simple flavor,
and that's a relief right now,
having had too many complex beers lately.

Only a tiny bit of sweet.

I'm trying to notice vanilla flavors in my stouts
since so many are described as vanilla,
and I never notice it.

This one has no hint of vanilla.

Aftertaste fades pretty fast.

## Mouthfeel
