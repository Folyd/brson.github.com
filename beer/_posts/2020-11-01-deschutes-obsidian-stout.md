Obsidian Stout.
Deschutes.
Bend, Oregon.

I love stout!

This has been waiting in my refrigerator for too long.

6.4% ABV

Minimal brown head.

## Smell

Chocolate. Walnuts.
Slight sweetness.
When swirled, some fruit, but I can't place it.

Not as strong as I'd hope.

## Taste

That is a good stout.
No adjuncts like many popular stouts right now,
but not as dull as many traditional stouts.

Aimee says it's "quite a balanced beer".

Toasty.
Slightly bitter.

It has an aftertaste.
Aimee describes it as "caramel".
I describe it as burnt chocolate.

Aimee says "smokey".

## Mouthfeel

Not so viscous as many stouts. Good.

Coats the mouth for a while in a way that is not too pleasant,
but typical for stouts.

## Overall

Great every day stout.

I typically prefer stronger stouts,
thinking they have more flavor,
but this is a lower ABV stout with some great classic stout flavor.

I like it more than Sierra Navada Narwhal and Bell's Kalamazoo,
which I have enjoyed recently,
and are in a similar category,
though Kalamazoo does have additional licorice.

I could make this my go-to.
