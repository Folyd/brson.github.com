Abt 12.
St. Bernardus.
Watau, Belgium.

A Belgian quadruppel.

My favorite Belgian abbey ale recently.
I've had a lot of them,
and this being our last bottle,
finally need to review it,
after previously reviewing their Tripel and Christmas ale.

10% ABV.

## Appearance

Typically frothy pour for a Belgian strong ale.
Almost uncontrollable.
Big bubbles that hold their shape well.
Looks like the very best polluted lake.

Dark brown and opaque.

## Smell

Sweet and refreshing.
A little bit of natural grape juice.

Aimee says "grape juice?"
We often disagree on our palettes,
but doesn't everybody?

## Taste

I continue to stand by my grape juice claim.

It's yummy.

I can taste the alcohol.

It's a fairly challenging beer,
not something you drink fast.

## Mouthfeel

but I am kind of tired of this style of beer,
and am enjoying more delicate and
less alcoholic beers lately.

This might have been a 5 for me a few weeks ago but today it's a
