title: "A Rusted Life"

Today I was fired from Mozilla, where I worked on the Rust team for
six years. It was a long time coming.

I was the longest-standing member of the Rust team, and something of
myself is part of Rust now.

Rust was the project of a lifetime, and I am fortunate to have
stumbled into it. I intended to build my career around Rust, and for
now I am adrift again. It's the most frightening time of my life.

The reasons for my termination are reasonable, and I don't fault Aaron
for doing it; though I am honestly angry with how he has treated me.
I have become almost impossible to work with due to mental health
issues (what I believe to be a personality disorder), and my
unpredictable behavior has caused repeated emotional distress to my
coworkers, and, to a lesser extent, members of the Rust community.
The value I bring to Mozilla is far less than the difficulties I
create.

This could be the end of my entire programming career.

At this critical juncture in my life, while Rust is still a vital part
of my existence, I've decided to summarize my entire experience, as an
engineer, an open source contributor, as a founding member of the Rust
project, and most importantly, as someone dealing with the
interminable pain of mental illness. This could be the last
significant contribution I make to the project I've dedicated my
existance to, and I want it to be honest. I hope that it will provide
me some catharsis, provide others insight into the early history of
Rust, and perhaps speak to others who feel the ways I do.

# How I got into Rust

In 2010 I was working at Cintas, in Cincinnati, Ohio, writing software
for handheld systems in C#. I didn't love it, but was pretty good at
it, and I was recognized for my skill. It's one of my weaknesses that
I highly value being recognized and respected. A lot of the behaviors
that doomed my career at Mozilla were also evident then, but I got out
before they became a problem.
