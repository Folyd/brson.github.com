## Panicking instead of error propagation

## Not chaining errors

## Not adding context to errors

## Unsafe pointer casting

- misaligned pointers

## Using unchecked functions

- e.g. `str::from_utf8_unchecked`

## Safe functions that should be unsafe

## Putting lifetimes into types

## Writing async code
