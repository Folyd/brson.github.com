title: "Cognitive behavioral therapy hints"
---

A collection of shorthand information useful for basic cognitive
behavioral therapy, derived from worksheets and other resources
originating with David Burns. These are hints to myself for completing
the cognitive techniques I use in particular.

## Moods

- **Sad**: blue, depressed, down, unhappy
- **Anxious**: worried, panicky, nervous, frightened
- **Guilty**: remorseful, bad, ashamed,
- **Inferior**: worthless, inadequate, defective, incompetent
- **Lonely**: unloved, unwanted, rejected, alone, abandoned
- **Embarrassed**: foolish, humiliated, self-conscious
- **Hopeless**: discouraged, pessimistic, despairing, overwhelmed
- **Frustrated**: stuck, thwarted, defeated
- **Angry**: mad, resentful, annoyed, irritated, upset, furious

## Cognitive distortions

- **All-or-nothing thinking (AoN)**. Also known as black-and-white
  thinking. Seeing only one side of the story, seeing only extremes.
  Situations and people's motivations are usually not so simple.
- **Overgeneralization (OG)**. Seeing negative events as a consistent
  pattern, not recognizing that sometimes good things happen too.
- **Mental filter (MF)**. Placing undue weight on only the negatives
  in a situation.
- **Discounting the positive (DP)**. Seeing only the negatives in a
  situation or in yourself.
- **Jumping to conclusions**
  - **Mind-reading (MR)**. Assuming what others are thinking.
  - **Fortune telling (FT)**. Assuming what will happen.
- **Magnification (Mag)** and **Minimization (Min)**. Blowing things
  out of proportion. Most distressing thoughts aren't so horrible as
  they feel in the moment.
- **Emotional reasoning (ER)**. Rationalizing thoughts based on your
  feelings.
- **Should statements (SH)**. Thinking that the world should be a
  certain way is a guaranteed path to unhappiness when the world isn't
  that way.
- **Labeling (LBL)**. Reductionist name-calling, of yourself or
  others, masks the reality of what is happening. e.g. I'm not an
  asshole, I merely said something inconsiderate.
- **Blame**
  - **Self-blame (SB)**
  - **Other-blame (OB)**

## Probing questions

Some useful questions to ask about distressing thoughts, to help
uncover additional thoughts and insight. Combinations of these are
used in a variety of techniques.

- "Is it true?"
- "Can I know it's true?" - afaict the answer to this is always
  supposed to be "no". Insisting a negative thought is true is a sign
  of obstinate resistence to further inquiry.
- "How do I react when I think that thought?"
- "Can you see reasons to let this thought go?"
- "What benefit does having this thought bring you?"
- "Who would I be if I didn't have that thought?"
- "If that were true what would it say about me?"
- "If that were true then what would the consequences be?"
- "Why does that matter?"
- "How would I treat a friend who had this thought?"

## Turnarounds

These are ways to expand your thinking about a subject by
reformulating statements to have different and opposite meanings. It's
almost always possible to find some truth in the opposite of whatever
negative thing you are thinking.

As example, given the statement "Molly should love me", the turnarounds

- to the opposite: "Molly should not love me"
- to the other: "I should love Molly"
- to the self: "I should love me"

I find it's easiest to apply these to very simple statements, so if I
am thinking something complex I'll reduce it to multiple single-clause
statements and turn them each around invididually. Depending on the
statement sometimes it's possible to come up with other turnarounds:
look for words to negate and perspectives to swap. Also try instead
of simply negating words, replacing words with their opposites.

How is the turnaround true? Is it as true as the original thought?
