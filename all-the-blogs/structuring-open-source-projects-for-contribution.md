title: "Structuring open source projects for contribution"
---

A research project to determine the effectiveness of approaches to
encouraging contribution to open source software in the Rust
community.

Some open source ecosystems are developed by a community of
contributors, and depend on the strength and growth of their
development community for the health of the ecosystem.

In the Rust community we've seen several projects recently that share
certain structures intended to encourage contribution by a broad base
of contributors.

This is an analysis of which project characteristics successfully
yield effective contributions.

## Hypotheses

- 

## Project variables

- tracking link
- start date
- end date
- duration
- discrete work items
- loc
- total PRs
- total code contributors
- total discussion contributors
- repeatable work items?
- itemized
- activity frequency
- actively managed
- difficulty
- contributor retention

## Notes

- examples
  - Rust emscripten
  - rust-cookbook
  - rustc error overhaul
  - libz blitz
  - style guidelines
  - Rust reference
