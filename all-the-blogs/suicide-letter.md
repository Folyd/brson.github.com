To whomever is interested.

I am dead by suicide. It was quick and painless.

After a suicide people are often left with lots of questions without
answers. I've attempted to pre-emptively address them here.

- Why did I do this?

I've been in pain for most of my life, and I've tried hard to address
it. Sometimes it seems the more I grow the more pain I feel. I don't
love myself, I don't love others, and I don't recieve the love that I
want. My mind is self-centered; my world is my pain. I think this is
never going to change. I feel hopeless and alone.

- Is it your fault?

No. It is nobody's fault. Sometimes this happens to people.

- Could you have done anything?

No. Nobody could have changed this outcome. My life was always going
to end this way.



TODO: answer questions

This will be traumatic for some. Grief is normal. If you hurt please
get help. See a grief councilor or psychotherapist, read some books on
grieving. Here are a few that look good:

- Finding Peace Without All The Pieces
- It's OK that You're Not OK
- Night Falls Fast
- Healing After Loss
- Dying to Be Free
- The Gift of Second
- I Wasn't Ready to Say Goodbye
- Shattered: From Grief to Joy
