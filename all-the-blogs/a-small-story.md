## After the party

They were on their way back to Sadland after attending a friend's house party in The City.
It was late, and it was dark.
There were few other vehicles on the road.
Cherry was driving.
He wasn't drunk like the others, but he was stoned.
They were all stoned.
Pear was up front, operating the music, and making provocative statements to provoke Cherry's emotions.
Apple was laying in the back.
He drank a lot that night.

Apple: "I'm going to puke. Pull over."

Cherry did not pull over in time.

Cherry: "Dammit, A. That sucks."

Cherry spent the next day cleaning its car.
