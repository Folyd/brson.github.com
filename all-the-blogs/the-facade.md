title: "The facade"
---

Reality is a facade over our true epxeriences and emotions, smooths out
the depths of feelinge, ups and down, makes everything normal and ok;
but underneeth, inside of us, is a volient reactor, erupting in
unpredictable ways, producing emotions that are frightening and
unrecogonizable, and hard to face. But it'll be there inside, if we can
look past the facade.
